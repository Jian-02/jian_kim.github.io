| Windows | C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts|
| Linux | /etc/hosts|  
  
`nslookup` -> command that check name server.  
Use DNS server address -> It means that register the address in the server.  
  
## Kernel & Driver
  
Windows: If connect hardware, user could use the HW.(It means computer has the driver about HW)  
Linux: It needs the module in the kernel, and install drivers.  
* Kernel: Help that system gets the hardware information.  
* Driver: Help to run hardware in the application.  
  
`make xconfig`  
: After download kernel source file, user could control the module on & off(kernel customizing).  
`make install`  
: Kernel compile & install.  
`vi /etc/grub & grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`
