# What is gax?
the history of gax  
```
Config Manager(CM), Solution Control Interface(SCI) -> gax -> gax  
```
Interaction Routing Design(IRD) doesnt' have replacement.  
Most value could see using GAX. But GAX doesn't often have the informaiton of CM or SCI.  
  
# Genesys Issue website
*I think that it's same to IPS visualizer*
* account means 고객사(customer)  
  
# Log tools
* Kazimir -> could see the log of SIP and CTI  
* SIP Visualizer -> couldn't see the log of CTI.  
  
CTI log is alike the support phone event log  
  
# Design the number of URS
In general, the number of URS is same to the number of SIP. But sometimes doesn't same, to verify it.  
  
# What is confserver?
ConfServer means that save the configuration of many servers.  
It means that it's need to start at the beginning.  
Confserver does manager and maintainance.  
  
# and other tips
command, working directory,, .... -> auto fill. and it could see using LCA.  
LCA port : 4999 port  
LCA could brint the status value and store it conf server.
