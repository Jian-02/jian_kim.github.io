# CentOS  
## How to add virtual hard disk
use system edit.  
```
fdisk /dev/sdb?
(n) means add
(p) means check
(w) means write
```
check that VHD add `ls -l /dev/sdb?`  
```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb? -> means init sdb as ext4 extension.
mount /dev/sdb? /(desntination) -> mount
```
  
## RAID(Redundant Array & Inexpensive Disk)
Use various disk once  
HW is more comportable, expensive.  
SW is more cheap.  
Linear RAID -> Trust, but slow.  
RAID0 -> less trust, but fast.  
RAID1 -> best trust, backup  
  
## LVM(Logical Volume Manage)
Combine and Split hard disk  
Phisical volume -> /dev/sda... partion -> `pvcreate`  
Volume Group -> Combile phisical volume -> `vgcreate`  
Logical Volume -> Combine Volume group -> `lvcreate`
  
  
## Quater
Restrict file space or number of files that user or group can create per file system.  
  
## Telent Server  
Remote connect, weak at security.  
server:  
```
sudo yum install -y telnet-server
systemctl restart telnet.service
systemctl status telnet.service
systemctl enable telnet.service
```
  
client:
```
sudo yum install -y telnet
telnet 127.0.0.1 (local)
```
