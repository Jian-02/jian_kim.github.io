2022/12/16 Freshman Training of Hansol Inticube.  
Instructor is **김희태**.  
  
## Linux
  
OS is CentOS, not Ubuntu.  
Basically it's same to ubuntu, but there are some differences about command.  
1. ipconfig <-> ip a
2. yum <-> apt
3. dpkg <-> rpm
  
## Shell  
  
Korn Shell?? I don't know...

  
## Script
  
?? just do.
