Follow the above table, SIP is placed on 7 layer, Application.  
HTTPS is also place on 7 layer. I don't know why, HTTPS and SIP is same response message.  
  
  


------
## Proxy, Redirect, Location server
# Proxy server
Client send some signal, then proxy server response. Proxy server decide where is the destination. But the exclude doesn't know where the destination.  
# Redirect Server
Same to proxy server, but the exclude could know the destination.  
# Location server
It decide where the client post to.
