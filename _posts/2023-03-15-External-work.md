# SH card
08:30 ~ 11:30 Monitoring  
  
Monitoring TODO  
1. Check process  
* `ps -elf | grep ㅁㅁserver`  
2. Check log (잘 올라가는지, 시간)
* `tail`  
  
ShinhanCard: URS -> irserver  
`irserver_print.log` -> check the IRD runs well.  
db1 server -> is alike to glab-framework1(confserv)  
`EventAttachedDataChanged` It attaches any events, if there is not some server that server causes error.  
  
ReRouting: ivr print log -> to/from check  
  
# DM
12:45 ~ 14:00 Issue shooting  
clients -> OOS, Logout, Expired...
