# CTI Bridge  
  
CTI: PVX doesn't know who call, but CTI could know who call using DB.  

Avaya doesn't provide CTI.  
  
# PBX  
  
## IP PBX  
전략을 세워준다...  
  
## IP Phone  
End point of call.  
  
## G450 GateWay  
Present GateWay.  
Previous call must be connected to gateway using cable.  
PSTN connect gateway, then gateway connect IP-PBX. IP-PBX divided each phone.  
* PNTN: original call cable, not IP.  
Physical connect part -> TDM. Virtual/IP connection -> IP.  
  
## AVAYA AMS  
Implement Software GateWay  
So, more efficient thant G450.  
  
# Dialplan  
  
## dac(dial access code), tac(trunk access code), fac(feature access code)  
  
## extention(ext) -> 내선 범위(사내 내선 범위)
